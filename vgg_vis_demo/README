The script VGG_visualisation.py includes code for testing visualisation techniques using a pre-trained model. A VGG16 network trained on the Imagenet dataset is initialised and a single sample image is passed through to test classification. Blocks of code can be uncommented to test various visualisation techniques. The package keras-vis is used to perform activation maximisation and gradient-based saliency mapping. Other code is included in order to plot first layer feature maps and perform occlusion mapping.
